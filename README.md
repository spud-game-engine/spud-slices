# Spud-Slices v1.2.1

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/spud-game-engine/spud-slices/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/spud-game-engine/spud-slices?branch=master) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spud-game-engine/spud-slices.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/spud-game-engine/spud-slices)

The library that lets you make shapes.

This library is a component of Lazerbeak12345's larger, Spud Game Engine (SGE).
It is designed to be a base for libraries such as physics engines. Primarally,
it works with 2d applications only, but it should, in the future be able to work
in 3d.

## Unit testing

Run `npm test` for basic testing. It will build, then run the program in node,
as it is written in TypeScript. I don't yet know how to make it run in a browser
env, but I'm looking into it.
