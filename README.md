# PotatoChips v0.0.0

The library that lets you make shapes.

This library is a component of Lazerbeak12345's larger, Spud Game Engine (SGE).
It is designed to be a base for libraries such as physics engines. Primarally,
it works with 2d applications only, but it should, in the future be able to work
in 3d.
