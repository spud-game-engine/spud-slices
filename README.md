# Spud-Slices v0.0.0

The library that lets you make shapes.

This library is a component of Lazerbeak12345's larger, Spud Game Engine (SGE).
It is designed to be a base for libraries such as physics engines. Primarally,
it works with 2d applications only, but it should, in the future be able to work
in 3d.

## Unit testing

If you open index.html in a web-browser, it automatically does a complete unit
test of the library. If you would like to contribute to the unit testing, for
now, the tests are held in `main.js`.

> NOTE: Now moving unit testing to ava unit testing. Old stuff is now just for
> reference so I can make the new stuff.
